    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kazuma Sato (Kazuma), a high school student who lost his life in an accident, is in another world to the goddess Aqua in the heavensI am approached to transfer to.
      She recommends a transfer to another world, bringing out the benefits, saying, "You can only bring one thing you want to another world."
      However, since Aqua was laughing at Kazuma as a fool, Kazuma designates Aqua as "something to take to another world" and gets involved in the transfer. 
      In this way, Kazuma, who took Aqua and landed in the other world, "Axel City", became an ordinary adventurer with unusually good luck, and Aqua, who had low luck and intelligence but high stats in all other things, 
      became an Arc Priest. After that, Megumin, an arc wizard who is a user of explosive magic but can't move after firing a single shot, and Darkness, a perverted crusader who looks beautiful but has a paranoid habit and can't be attacked at all. 
      In addition to his colleagues, he spends his days being swayed by their problematic behavior.
      However, their problematic behavior, which does not know where to stay beyond imagination, involves Kazuma in various turmoil, such as trouble with the demon king's army, consultation with the great demon,
      a fight over money with an unscrupulous lord, and finally the goddess running away from home.</p>
